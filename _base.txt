Vector images -> level 3 Postscript
Raster images -> PSD/XCF/24-bit TGA or 32-bit TGA if alpha channel needed
Vector is preferable to raster.

Models -> Decide on something. COLLADA maybe? Though XML is to be avoided.

Maps -> id Tech 3 or 4 map, probably interchangable

Sound -> 441000Hz+ 16-bit+ PCM WAV
