Vector images -> PDF 1.4/1.5. Exported Documents should be dimensioned for 
	rendering correctly at 90dpi. N.B.: alpha or layer opacity below 100% 
	will completely break rendering with Ghostscript. Actually, this might
	be an Inkscape bug, but ok.

Raster images -> PSD/XCF/24-bit TGA or 32-bit TGA if alpha channel needed

Models -> Decide on something. ASE? MD5? COLLADA?

Maps -> id Tech 3 or id Tech 4 map, probably interchangable.

Sound -> 441000Hz+ 16-bit+ PCM WAV, preferably mono.
