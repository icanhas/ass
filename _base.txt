Vector images -> PDF 1.4/1.5 if vector contains transparency, otherwise 
	level 3 Postscript. Exported Documents should be dimensioned for 
	rendering at 90dpi.
Raster images -> PSD/XCF/24-bit TGA or 32-bit TGA if alpha channel needed
Vector is preferable to raster.

Models -> Decide on something. COLLADA?

Maps -> id Tech 3 or id Tech 4 map, probably interchangable
